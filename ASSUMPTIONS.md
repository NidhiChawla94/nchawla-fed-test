## Description of my solution

The solution would initially load 5 random users and then on click of 'Load More' it will load more.

## Things I would do next

Unit testing.

## Assumptions that I made

1. The part 1 url was initially set to 'https://randomuser.me/api/' but for part 2 I have changed the url. I have assumed that part 1 has to be changed to complete part 2 and not two completely different solutions.
